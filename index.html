            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

            <p>Although AI has brought transformative changes to various aspects of life,  its impact on researchers unfolds in a nuanced manner. On the one hand, AI assists in various research disciplines, such as Social Science, Finance, Medicine, GeoScience, Math, etc., significantly expediting academic processes. However, it's important to note that these AI programs are still guided by human researchers. On the flip side, the AI era poses challenges for researchers. While it streamlines certain tasks, researchers find themselves still having to undergo years of professional training, extensive paper reading to stay current, quicker ideation due to fast-paced advancements, and a growing number of papers to review. It appears that AI is pushing them to work harder and be more productive. In contemplating the future, the question looms: Can AI potentially replace researchers as autonomous scientists?</p>

            <h2 id="CFP">Call for Papers</h2>
            <p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers from different disciplines who are interested in how AI is made use of to assist, accelerate, and even automate their research activities.

            <p>Prof. Eneko Agirre: "<b>Few-shot Information Extraction:  Pre-train, prompt and entail</b>"</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Deep Learning has made tremendous progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where large pre-trained language models (PLM) fine-tuned on the target task have become the predominant tool. More recently, in a process called prompting, NLP tasks are rephrased as natural language text, allowing us to better exploit linguistic knowledge learned by PLMs and resulting in significant improvements. Still, PLMs have limited inference ability. In the Textual Entailment task, systems need to output whether the truth of a certain textual hypothesis follows from the given premise text.  Manually annotated entailment datasets covering multiple inference phenomena have been used to infuse inference capabilities to PLMs. This talk will review these recent developments, and will present an approach that combines prompts and PLMs fine-tuned for textual entailment that yields state-of-the-art results on Information Extraction (IE) using only a small fraction of the annotations. The approach has additional benefits, like the ability to learn from different schemas and inference datasets. These developments enable a new paradigm for IE where the expert can define the domain-specific schema using natural language and directly run those specifications, annotating a handful of examples in the process. A user interface based on this new paradigm will also be presented. Beyond IE, inference capabilities could be extended, acquired and applied from other tasks, opening a new research avenue where entailment and downstream task performance improve in tandem.</p>

            <p>Prof. Heng Ji: "<b>Few-shot Event Argument Extraction via Natural Language or Programming Language Generation</b>"</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: The goal of the event argument role labeling task is to find finding the arguments
  (participants) of an event. Traditional methods model this task as a supervised classification problem
  that requires a large amount of training data (around 4,000 fully annotated sentences). By contrast,
  when humans know some events happened (e.g., Halloween parade in Champaign), they would expect to know a
  list of arguments - attendees, time, location, organizer, etc., actively seek information to fill in these
  slots by reading news or social media, and then they will be able to describe the information about these
  arguments to their friends. Therefore, if an intelligent information system knows how to narrate an event,
  it should be able to fill in the slots for the expected argument roles. We propose to re-frame the problem
  as conditional generation given a template (a list of arguments for each event type). Conditioned on the
  unfilled template and a given natural language context, the model is asked to generate a filled-in template
  with arguments. We can train this generator using a large language model learned from natural language, or,
  even better, from programming language, both of which are readily available. For example, event-argument
  structures can be represented as a class object using code. This alignment between structures and code
  enables us to take advantage of Programming Language features such as inheritance and type annotation to
  introduce external knowledge or add constraints. Our model does not require any substantial amount of
  annotations for the information extraction task, and thus it's highly effective for zero-shot or
  few-shot settings. Also it can work with long contexts beyond single sentences, and bring us one step
  closer to the original goal of information extraction - constructing a knowledge base from the entire corpus.
  When only using 50 training instances for each event type, our framework is comparable to fully-supervised
  models trained on 4,202 event instances. When given the same 50-shot data, our approach outperforms current
  state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 20.8% absolute F1.</p>

            <p>Dr. Hoifung Poon: "<b>Self-Supervised AI for Precision Health</b>"</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: The advent of big data promises to revolutionize medicine by making it more personalized and effective, but big data also presents a grand challenge of information overload. For example, tumor sequencing has become routine in cancer treatment, yet interpreting the genomic data requires painstakingly curating knowledge from a vast biomedical literature, which grows by thousands of papers every day. Electronic medical records contain high-definition patient information for speeding up clinical trial recruitment and drug development, but curating such real-world evidence from clinical notes can take hours for a single patient. Natural language processing (NLP) can play a key role in interpreting big data for precision medicine. In particular, machine reading can help unlock knowledge from text by substantially improving curation efficiency. However, standard supervised methods require labeled examples, which are expensive and time-consuming to produce at scale. In this talk, I'll present Project Hanover, where we overcome the annotation bottleneck by combining deep learning with probabilistic logic, by exploiting self-supervision from readily available resources such as ontologies and databases, and by leveraging domain-specific pretraining on unlabeled text. This enables us to extract knowledge from tens of millions of publications, structure real-world data for millions of cancer patients, and apply the extracted knowledge and real-world evidence to supporting precision oncology. </p>

            <p>Prof. Yizhou Sun: "<b>Combining Representation Learning and Logical Rule Reasoning for Knowledge Graph Inference</b>"</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Knowledge graph inference has been studied extensively due to its wide applications. It has been addressed by two lines of research, i.e., the more traditional logical rule reasoning and the more recent knowledge graph embedding (KGE). In this talk, we will introduce two recent developments in our group to combine these two worlds. First, we propose to leverage logical rules to bring in high-order dependency among entities and relations for KGE. By limiting the logical rules to be the definite Horn clauses, we are able to fully exploit the knowledge in logical rules and enable the mutual enhancement of logical rule-based reasoning and KGE in an extremely efficient way. Second, we propose to handle logical queries by representing fuzzy sets as specially designed vectors and retrieving answers via dense vector computation. In particular, we provide embedding-based logical operators that strictly follow the axioms required in fuzzy logic, which can be trained by self-supervised knowledge completion tasks. With additional query-answer pairs, the performance can be further enhanced. With these evidence, we believe combining logic with representation learning provides a promising direction for knowledge reasoning. </p>
